This has led to an increase in the number of malware targeting Android devices. The lack of robust security enforcement in Play Store along with the rapid increase in the number of new Android malware presents a scope for a variety of diverse malicious applications to spread across devices. Furthermore, Android allows installation of an application from unverified sources (e.g., third-party market and sideloading), which opens up other ways for malware to infect the smartphones. This paper presents DeepDetect that enables on-device malware detection by employing a machine learning based model on static features. With effective feature engineering, DeepDetect can be used on-device. To classify an Android application as malware, it takes ∼5.32 seconds, which is 2.23X faster than API based malware detector, while consuming 0.45% (for 50 applications) of total device energy. DeepDetect provides a malware detection rate of 99.9% for known malware with a 0.01% false-positive rate. For unseen/new samples, it detects more than 97% malware with a false-positive rate of 173%. Further, in the presence of obfuscated malware, DeepDetect correctly detects 95.57% of malware samples. We have also evaluated our model against the Pegasus malware sample and with a new dataset after removing the potential biases across space and time.","tags":[],"title":"DeepDetect: A Practical On-device Android Malware Detector","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635323400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635323400,"objectID":"0f70c83f0fb99d53d1957434cc753b67","permalink":"https://skmtr1.github.io/talk/mobile-forensics-and-challenges-perspective-of-indian-investigators/","publishdate":"2021-11-28T13:20:47+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/mobile-forensics-and-challenges-perspective-of-indian-investigators/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Mobile Forensics and Challenges: Perspective of Indian Investigators","type":"event"},{"authors":["Saurabh Kumar","Debadatta Mishra","Biswabandan Panda","Sandeep Kumar Shukla"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1607472000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607472000,"objectID":"0f32793077afb67625095476d38f84ed","permalink":"https://skmtr1.github.io/publication/stdneut/","publishdate":"2021-11-23T10:58:33+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/stdneut/","section":"publication","summary":"Sophisticated malware employs various emulation-detection techniques to bypass the dynamic analysis systems that are running on top of virtualized environments. Hence, a defense mechanism needs to be incorporated in emulation based analysis platforms to mitigate the emulation-detection strategies opted by malware. In this paper, first we design an emulation-detection library that has configurable capabilities ranging from basic to advanced detection techniques like distributed detection and GPS information. We use this library to arm several existing malware with different levels of emulation-detection capabilities and study the efficacy of anti-emulation-detection measures of well known emulator driven dynamic analysis frameworks. Furthermore, we propose STDNeut (Sensor, Telephony system, and Device state information Neutralizer) -- a configurable anti-emulation-detection mechanism that defends against the basic as well as advanced emulation-detection techniques regardless of which layer of Android OS the attack is performed on. Finally, we perform various experiments to show the effectiveness of STDNeut. Experimental results show that STDNeut can effectively execute a malware without being detected as an emulated platform.","tags":[],"title":"STDNeut: Neutralizing Sensor, Telephony System and Device State Information on Emulated Android Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saurabh Kumar","Sandeep Kumar Shukla"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584511852,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584511852,"objectID":"c6f66e482f1637013d865c45dda297d2","permalink":"https://skmtr1.github.io/publication/and-security/","publishdate":"2021-11-23T11:40:52+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/and-security/","section":"publication","summary":"In today’s world of devices, smart phones, tablets, and wearable devices, are widely used for communication, photography, entertainment, monitoring health status, and many more applications.

This requires an efficient malware detection system which can be used in mass market and is capable of mitigating zero-day threats as opposed to signature-based approach which requires regular update of database. In this paper, an efficient host-server-based malicious app detection system is presented where on-device feature extraction is performed for the app to be analyzed and extracted features are sent over to remote server where machine learning is applied for malware analysis and detection. At server-end, static features such as permissions, app components, etc., have been used to train classifier using random forest algorithm resulting in detection accuracy of more than 97%.","tags":[],"title":"Host-Server-Based Malware Detection System for Android Platforms Using Machine Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Applications requiring high volume of streaming data transmission include audio-video conferencing or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Internet Protocol Television (IPTV). In general, whenever we use these types of applications the emphasis is always to achieve transfer rate as high as possible between one peer node and another. As a matter of fact while taking these things into consideration security issues related to data are always overlooked and this can cause a big problem. Also, when the data is transmitted over wireless network such as MANET (Mobile Ad hoc Network), the limited wireless bandwidth and computational capability will lead to new security challenges. This paper is a solution to such security problems which are faced in case of streaming data transmission.
